= Flint -- a firewall rule analyzer

Supported firewalls:

* Cisco Pix/ASA
* IOS almost...
* IPTables soon
* Pf soon

== Installing

gem install ./matasano_utils-0.1.gem
gem install ./Ralex-0.1.gem

It also needs the following gems:
* sinatra
* haml
* ohm
* rdiscount
* compass
* bcrypt-ruby

Flint also requires a working Redis server.  Redis is available at http://code.google.com/p/redis/

== Running

* Start redis
* The first time you run, you will need to do run 'rake init'
* 'rake app'

This will start a Sinatra server listening on port 4567.  Point your browser at that.

== Developers

You will need the racc and rdoc gem, and Ragel installed.  Ragel is available
at: http://www.complang.org/ragel/

== Project Layout

* `lib`

  Ruby code for the Flint module, as well as the support modules for
  specific firewall types.

* `app`

  The sinatra app which provides an interface to Flint.

* `checks`

  Contains all of firewall rule checks that Flint uses.  Each firewall
  has it's own subdir for example:

      checks/<firewall>/*.ftg

  Rule checks are defined in Flint Test Group files, each one defines
  a specific test group, and it's associated checks.  The
  `checks/test` subdir contains a set of dummy tests which exercise
  the UI and the Flint test result classes.

* spec

  RSpec tests for Flint.
