!--- Sets the global pool for hosts inside the firewall:

global (outside) 1 131.1.23.12-131.1.23.254

!--- Allows hosts in the 10.0.0.0 network to be
!--- translated through the PIX:

nat (inside) 1 10.0.0.0 

!--- Configures a static translation for an admin workstation 
!--- with local address 10.14.8.50:

static (inside,outside) 131.1.23.11 10.14.8.50

!--- Allows syslog packets to pass through the PIX from RTRA.
!--- You can use conduits OR access-lists to permit traffic.
!--- Conduits has been added to show the use of the command,
!--- however they are commented in the document, since the 
!--- recommendation is to use access-list.
!--- To the admin workstation (syslog server):
!--- Using conduit: 
!--- conduit permit udp host 131.1.23.11 eq 514 host 131.1.23.1 



!--- Using access-list:

Access-list 101 permit udp host 131.1.23.1 host 131.1.23.11 255.255.255.0 eq 514
Access-group 101 in interface outside

!--- Permits incoming mail connections to 131.1.23.10:

static (inside, outside) 131.1.23.10 10.10.254.3

!--- Using conduits
!--- conduit permit TCP host 131.1.23.10 eq smtp any
!--- Using Access-lists, we use access-list 101
!--- which is already applied to interface outside.

Access-list 101 permit tcp any host 131.1.23.10 eq smtp

!--- PIX needs static routes or the use of routing protocols
!--- to know about networks not directly connected.
!--- Add a route to network 10.14.8.x/24.

route inside 10.14.8.0 255.255.255.0 10.10.254.2

!--- Add a default route to the rest of the traffic 
!--- that goes to the internet.

Route outside 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 131.1.23.1

!--- Enables the Mail Guard feature 
!--- to accept only seven SMTP commands 
!--- HELO, MAIL, RCPT, DATA, RSET, NOOP, and QUIT:
!--- (This can be turned off to permit ESMTP by negating with 
!--- the no fixup protocol smtp 25 command):

fixup protocol smtp 25

!--- Allows Telnet from the inside workstation at 10.14.8.50 
!--- into the inside interface of the PIX:

telnet 10.14.8.50

!--- Turns on logging:

logging on

!--- Turns on the logging facility 20:

logging facility 20

!--- Turns on logging level 7:

logging history 7

!--- Turns on the logging on the inside interface:

logging host inside 10.14.8.50
