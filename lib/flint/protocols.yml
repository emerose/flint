SNMP: |
  SNMP is the Simple Network Management Protocol.  SNMP was designed to provide
  a standardized protocol for the management of devices on the network.
  By separating management information from the implementation of the management 
  tools themselves, a highly extensible protocol was developed that has survived 
  15 years, and 3 major revisions, without significantly altering the concepts 
  behind the protocol. [RFC1157, RFC1158]
  
  SNMP has the ability to both read and alter settings on managed devices.
  Bulk and walking methods allow users to grab large swaths of data quickly
  and easily.  Most implementations allow for the ability to limit access
  to read-only.
  
  The SNMP-Trap mechanism exists to allow SNMP managed devices,
  called agents, to autonomously send information to a management device,
  referred to as a manager.
  
  Currently deployed versions of SNMP include SNMPv1, SNMPv2c and SNMPv3.
  v1 and v2c use whats referred to as community based authentication, while
  v3 provides for more robust, cryptographically sound authentication
  methods.  While all versions of SNMP have security implications, the use
  of v1 and v2c are of particular concern when arbitrary users have access to
  these services.  As they are UDP, however, filtering with firewall rules is
  only of limited effectivity.

BGP4: |+
  BGP4 is the Internet's "exterior" routing protocol. In essence, it publishes
  to the entire Internet the IP address ranges, or "netblocks", owned by a 
  particular entity, or "autonomous system". Though heavily scrutinized and
  sanitized by upstream service providers, disruptions in BGP4 can have a
  catastrophic impact on connectivity to individual enterprises.
  
  Enterprises run BGP4 if they "multi-home" to more than one service provider. 
  BGP4 is spoken almost exclusively between core routers. Unlike "interior"
  routing protocols, only a few designated routers are normally BGP4-enabled.
  There is therefore no reason to allow arbitrary IP speakers to make connections
  on the BGP4 port.

BOOTPS: |+
  BOOTstrap Protocol Server (BOOTPS), is a network protocol used by a server to distribute IP addresses automatically. Computers configured to obtain addresses dynamcally usually request one from the server during the bootstrap process. The BOOTP servers assign the IP address from a pool of addresses to each client. The BOOTP protocol was originally defined in RFC 951. See DHCP.

DNS: |+
  The Domain Name System (DNS) is used to associate all kinds of information with domain names. Information is organized into resource records which may be distributed among many different name servers.
  
  The DNS protocol allows clients to issue queries (often via UDP port 53) to DNS servers which either have the required resource records, or can forward the query to a server who may have it (recursive queries).
  
  Portions of the DNS resource database can be replicated by deploying master and slave servers for a given zone. Slaves regularly update against the master by performing a zone transfer over TCP port 53.

DHCP: |
  Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)
  
  The DHCP protocol is used by network devices to otbain information 
  necessary for operation on a IP network with little or no manual 
  configuration of clients.  This protocol supercedes BOOTPS
  
  The information retrieved by a client via DHCP includes:
  
  * IP address
  * lease (the length of time for which this assignment is valid)
  * subnet mask
  * default gateway
  
  Methods of attacking DHCP take advantage of naive implementations of the 
  protocol.  Given that there is no authentication between client and 
  server, an opening is created for many possible attack vectors.
  
  A server could be placed on the network that transmits invalid 
  information would prevent legitimate users from connecting to your 
  network.  A rogue client on the network could spoof its MAC address to 
  make an unlimited amount of lease requests, eventually exhausting the 
  lease pool and also causing a denial of service for legitimate users.
  
  [rfc 3118](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3118.txt) was published in 2001 
  which provides a method of authenticating DHCP requests.  However, this 
  standard is not widely deployed and, if deployed, will tend to be 
  ackward compatible and not require authentication if a client doesn't 
  support it.

  Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol (L2TP) is a tunneling protocol used to support virtual private networks.

This protocol may also be used to solve the "multilink hunt-group splitting" problem. Multilink PPP, often used to aggregate ISDN B channels, requires that all channels composing a multilink bundle be grouped at a single Network Access Server (NAS). Because L2TP makes a PPP session appear at a location other than the physical point at which the session was physically received, it can be used to make all channels appear at a single NAS, allowing for a multilink operation even when the physical calls are spread across distinct physical NASs.

The X server provides a set of services that are used by client applications, such as input handling from keyboard and mouse, window operations, graphics text and font. The X applications act as clients, interacting with the user and other X clients via the X server. The need for network-transparent windowing systems has declined in recent decades, but the X Window System retains its ability for remote displays of client applications.
  
  The X Window System is considered very insecure, particularly when run remotely. Don't use it.

  OSPF is the de facto standard routing protocol for large enterprise

  and by doing so make decisions about how to route traffic.
  
  OSPF is spoken exclusively between routers. No end system needs to speak
  this protocol for OSPF routing to function. An attacker who can create a 
  valid OSPF connection (or "adjacency") can completely rewrite the routing
  tables of an entire network. Keep this one locked down.

  solves a chicken-and-egg problem for older systems whose flash storage couldn't store a fully-functional OS. Certain older Cisco appliances use TFTP for configuration. Some network-based OS installation systems, such as Solaris JumpStart and Apple NetBoot, use TFTP to boot remote workstations during their process.
  
  TFTP is considered an archaic protocol. Almost everything that used to rely on it can now use alternatives such as SSH. Try to get rid of it, or keep it locked down.

RIP: |
  Routing Information Protocol (RIP)
  
  RIP is a LAN and WAN dynamic routing protocol. Like other similar routing
  protocols RIP uses a distance vector algorithm to build its routing tables.
  Both RIP and RIPv2 are considered obseleted by newer dynamic routing protocols
  such as OSPF. Unlike its successors, the original RIP does not support any
  authentication mechanisms, making it an easy target for attackers. RIPv2 supports
  MD5 authentication.

SMTP: |
  SMTP is the Simple Mail Transport Protocol.  The defacto standard for mail
  over the internet -- while other systems exist (such as x.400),
  none has even a fraction of the deployed systems that SMTP does.  If you
  receive email, its almost definitely been received over SMTP.
  
  As a protocol, SMTP has remained largely unchanged since its definition.  
  A number of extensions have been added as the protocol has gained in popularity,
  including those supporting MIME encoding and decoding, and authenticated and 
  encrypted access.  Some of these extensions have been the source of 
  vulnerabilities in specific implementations of the SMTP protocol.
  
  The most popular SMTP agents, or Mail Transport Agents (MTA) are Sendmail and
  Exchange.  
  
  In Sendmail's close to 25 year history, it has had numerous, severe 
  vulnerabilities.  Improvements over that time have reduced the rate of
  vulnerabilities being reported to a trickle.  Its long history of problems,
  however, make many question its security.  Sendmail is responsible for the
  belief that SMTP is an inherently insecure protocol.  While the protocol 
  itself has flaws (a traditional lack of authentication or encryption, for one),
  a majority of the problems people associated with SMTP have in fact been
  Sendmail issues.
  
  Exchange has also had a number of severe vulnerabilities in its history.  Its
  codebase, much like Sendmail, has been thoroughly audited, and the rate of
  vulnerabilities being disclosed is low.  Its closed source nature is a source
  of concern for some.
  
  Alternate MTA's which were designed with security in mind include qmail and
  postfix.  Both have had minor vulnerabilities reported, but have withstood
  scrutiny.  Neither have anywhere near the number of deployments of Sendmail or
  Exchange, and as such, calling them 'better' or 'more secure' may be misguided.
  
  As a critical component of modern business, SMTP must be accessible to users
  both on the inside, and outside, of networks.  External users should only
  be allowed to use the external SMTP servers to deliver mail destined for the
  inside of the network.

  ORB is one or more applications, just as a CGI application attaches to 
  a web server.
  
  The security of CORBA depends on the security of the applications built on
  it, the same way the security of a web app depends on not accidentally allowing
  for SQL injection. There is one important addenda: CORBA has its own 
  name service. If an arbitrary client can connect to an ORB running the

  \NetBIOS Datagram (\NetBIOS-DGM) runs over UDP and is used by Microsoft Windows and services on UNIX such as SAMBA. Part of the set of NetBIOS services, the \NetBIOS datagram service provides delivery of datagrams that are connectionless, nonsequenced, and unreliable. Datagrams can be directed to a specific NetBIOS name or broadcast to a group of names. Delivery is unreliable in that only the users who are logged on to the network receive the message. The datagram service can initiate and receive both broadcast and directed messages. Specially crafted messages sent to this service can trick the Windows operating system into accepting that traffic as "local", thereby circumventing some of Microsoft's security settings that differentiate between "local" and "internet" zones.

XMPP: |
  eXtensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP)
  
  XMPP is a protocol that was originally developed by the Jabber open source community for near real-time instant messaging and presence information using XML-formatted messages (think XML streaming). An XMPP client will communicate via TCP to a server on port 5222. XMPP server to server messages use port 5269. In 2002, An independent workgroup, XMPP WG, was founded for the continued development of XMPP as a full-on standard protocol for presence and instant messaging as outlined in RFC 2779. As defined, XMPP should make use of Transport Layer Security TLS for channel encryption. The XMPP specification also supports an XMPP-specific method for  Simple Authentication and Security Layer SASL.

  HSRP authentication is done using a cleartext password.  This password is
  'cisco' by default.
  
  HSRP messages are sent to multicast address 224.0.0.2.
  
  Transmissions to HSRP should not be allowed by end-user machines.  Filtering
  this protocol, and limiting its use to dedicated management networks is highly
  recommended.

NFS: |+
  NFS is the Network File System protocol.  NFS is a distributed file system,
  that allows for file systems residing on remote machines to be accessed as

  NFS is an RPC based protocol.
  
  NFS has a history of vulnerabilities, some of which are related to its use of
  RPC as a transport, and some of which are directly related to the protocol
  itself.  A number of the authentication mechanisms utilized by RPC are
  considered weak; some may be observed by sniffing the network, while others
  may be attacked via a man-in-the-middle attack.  Even in situations where
  stronger authentication may be applied, downgrade attacks may be possible
  which can cause a lesser algorithm to be applied.
  
  Other attacks exist whereby an attacker can access files directly, without being subject to normal filesystem mounting restrictions, by guessing the handles
  NFS uses to provide file access.
  
  A number of the flaws in NFS have been addressed in NFSv4, including
  improved authenticatio mechanisms, and optional data encryption.

HTTP: |+
  Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application layer protocol used to retrieve and publish documents formatted in Hypertext Markup Language (HTML). HTTP is a request/response standard between a client and a server. A client is the end-user, the server is the web site. The client making an HTTP request - using a web browser, spider, or other end-user tool - is referred to as the user agent. The responding server - which stores or creates resources such as HTML files and images - is called the origin server. In between the user agent and origin server may be several intermediaries, such as proxies, gateways, and tunnels. HTTP is not constrained to using TCP/IP and its supporting layers, although this is its most popular application on the Internet. See also HTTPS.

  Megaco is a result of joint efforts of the IETF and the ITU-T Study Group 16. The protocol definition of this protocol is common text with ITU-T Recommendation H.248. It is similar to MGCP.
  
  The Megaco protocol is used between elements of a physically decomposed multimedia gateway. There are no functional differences from a system view between a decomposed gateway, with distributed sub-components potentially on more than one physical device, and a monolithic gateway such as described in H.246. This protocol creates a general framework suitable for gateways, multipoint control units and interactive voice response units (IVRs).
  
  Packet network interfaces may include IP, ATM or possibly others. The interfaces support a variety of SCN signalling systems, including tone signalling, ISDN, ISUP, QSIG and GSM. National variants of these signalling systems are supported where applicable.
  
  All messages are in the format of ASN.1 text messages.
