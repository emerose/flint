Questions we ask in our tests

Textual analysis

* Does ANY rule use ANY on destination host or port
* Does ANY rule allow destination of port X explicitely
* Does ANY rule allow detination of host X explicitely
* Is a non-rule option set, or command used (do they use fixup ftp on PIX?)

These questions can be answered with just the information contained in
a specific rule, with basic parsing.

Functional Analysis

* Can ANY hosts get from E to I on port X
* Can ANY hosts get from I to E on port X
* Can N+ hosts get from I to E on port X
* Can ANY hosts get from I to E on more than N ports
* Can ANY hosts get from E to I at N+ hosts on port X
* Can packets with flag X set go from E to I
* Can packets of protocol X go from I to E
* Can packets of protocol X go from E to I
* Which hosts can talk to host X on port Y

Accurately answering these questions requires knowing the default
behavior of the device, and how rules are processed.  Specifically, we
need to know the default policies, which rules are applied on which
interface, whether a rule match stops processing, or jumps to another
rule set, which interface is external/internal.

How we describe network policy

* Direction
* Destination
* Hosts
* Ports/Services
* Protocol (TCP/ICMP/UDP)

How firewall rule languages describe them...

Packet source/sink
  * interface(s)
  * net blocks

Packet specifications
  net blocks
  port ranges
  protocols
  packet states
  interfaces
  flags

Tables
  lists of packet specifications
 
Rules

Consist of two packet specs, in and out.
  * match
    * Pass
    * Deny
    * jump
  * transform
    * given an input spec, transforms it and returns a new spec
    
Chains of Rules
  * order of execution of rules
  * allows jump and flow control of rules
  * default policies
  * are bound to a direction or interface
